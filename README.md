# Algorithm-Sum-of-Digits---Digital-Root
is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing 
in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples.
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
